# ENGG*4450 – Large-Scale Software Architecture Engineering  
## Phase 2: Implementing Change Requests  
**Group 11 – Stanford CoreNLP Project**

---

### Overview
This repository contains the implementation and verification for **ENGG*4450 Phase 2**, focused on extending and testing the **Stanford CoreNLP** natural language processing (NLP) library.

Two issues from the CoreNLP issue tracker were selected and implemented:

1. **Issue #1394 – HTML Interface Not Reflecting Quote Annotator**  
   Verified that the Quote Annotator executed correctly through the HTTP API, successfully returning JSON output though not displayed in the HTML UI.

2. **Issue #1459 – Add Dockerfile for CoreNLP**  
   Implemented a working Dockerfile for containerized CoreNLP deployment, enabling consistent setup, testing, and reproducible execution across environments.
